# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) puzzles in Julia. My main programming language is still Python, so my Julia code is very likely not optimal. If you notice something that could be done in a better (more idiomatic) way, please let me know!
