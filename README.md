# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) puzzles in Julia. My main programming language is still Python, so my Julia code is very likely not optimal. If you notice something that could be done in a better (more idiomatic) way, please let me know!

One thing I do need to change is to make sure all scripts run outside the REPL. Currently, I put a lot of objects in the global namespace, which works in the REPL, but not in non-interactive mode. All solutions should be refactored (put into functions) so that they do not need to be run from the REPL.
